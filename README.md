# Development-of-classification-models-for-prostate-cancer-progression

This study aims to explore gene expression value-based prostate cancer progression as normal, benign, or tumor using machine learning and deep learning models. The dataset is a combination of multiple datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), comprising thousands of gene features across multiple patient samples. Basic preprocessing steps are performed on the dataset, and relevant feature selection is performed to select the most relevant genes to improve model performance. A random forest (RF) classifier and feedforward neural network (FFNN) were used as ML and DL models, respectively, and their performance was compared. Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy were used for comparison. The RF model showed better accuracy over varied feature selection and with hyperparameter tuning as compared to the ANN model. This study and model performance show how the application of Machine learning and deep learning approaches can improve cancer diagnostics in the future
